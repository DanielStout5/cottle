Cottle: Compact Object to Text Transform Language
=================================================

Overview
--------

Hi, and thank you for reading this.

Cottle is an open-source (BSD) template engine I wrote because I needed
something light and efficient at work, and was not pleased with other
available libraries. If you never used a template engine before, here is a
simple explanation about how it works:

- A program of yours generated some structured data, for example a list of
products with associated name, description, quantity and price for each of
them.
- You want to make out an invoice from this list, meaning you want to render
them as a formatted text document like an HTML page, an XML file or a plain
text file.
- Cottle allows you to write a template, that is a file that describes how your
data should be printed to produce the final invoice. Once the template is
ready, it can be re-used with any products list as long as it keeps the same
structure (in our example, products with names, descriptions, quantities and
prices).

Cottle can read template files written with its own syntax (as explained in the
user manual), them transform data sources into rendered text documents.



Installation
------------

This repository contains a Visual Studio 2010 C# solution with two projects:

- Cottle, the library itself, which is the project you'll include in your own
solution if you want to use it. It is compatible with .NET 3.5 and above.
- Demo, a simple Windows Form test program that allows you to write templates
directly in a text box and render them using predefined data.

User manual (available as "manual.html" or at http://sub.mirari.fr/cottle/)
explains how to use the library, and contains a lot of code examples.
