X Move function registration to Document class: make parser aware of functions without known list, update FunctionExpression
X Handle "elif" keyword
X Replace strings by IValues as keys in IValue.Children (should be optimized for both numeric and string values)
X Change IValue.Children structure to allow children ordering function (like "sort")
X Handle "while" keyword
X Implement IValue GetHashCode method to allow IValue-based lookups (no more cast to strings)
X Implement function declarations
