X Move function registration to Document class: make parser aware of functions without known list, update FunctionExpression
X Handle "elif" keyword
X Replace strings by IValues as keys in IValue.Children (should be optimized for both numeric and string values)
X Change IValue.Children structure to allow children ordering function (like "sort")
X Handle "while" keyword
X Implement IValue GetHashCode method to allow IValue-based lookups (no more cast to strings)
X Implement function declarations
X Add new common functions: len, asc, ord
X Allow function evaluation within callbacks
	X Add new common functions: pos, sort, map
X Merge variable and function declarations: {declare x, y, z}, {set x to 1}, {set x() to: dummy}
	X Fix scope issues, remove unused scopes in "for" enumerations?
	! Declare a special "index" variable within "for" body?
X Merge "nth" and "slice" common functions
- min and max should work on arrays
- Implement better text trimming system
- Add support for comments
- Write deserializers?
	- From .NET object with attributes
